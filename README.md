# Quiz-Game

# Task

In this Challenge I created a 4 question quiz game that tests the user's coding knowledge.

# Homepage

The user can select the start button to start the game or the Last Score button to check what his/her last score was if they have already played the game.

# Gameplay

The user has 30 seconds to answer all 4 questions. The user is awarded 10 points for each correct answer and the remaining seconds left are added to the score as points. For each wrong answer 5 seconds are removed from the clock. When all questions are completed or the clock runs out, the game is over.

# Score Logging

When the game is over the user is prompted to enter his/her initials. The initials and score are logged to the local storage and are displayed on the page.
